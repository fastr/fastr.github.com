Node.js on OpenEmbeded
=====

The successful build instructions in a nutshell:

    opkg install python python-modules python-distutils python-misc
    opkg install task-sdk-native
    opkg install openssl openssl-dev
    wget http://nodejs.org/dist/node-v0.1.102.tar.gz
    tar xf node-v0.1.102.tar.gz
    cd node-v0.1.102
    export CC='gcc -march=armv7-a -mtune=cortex-a8' # -march=armv5te works for older systems
    export CXX='g++ -march=armv7-a -mtune=cortex-a8'
    ./configure
    make
    make install


Tracing Errors
=====

There are a number of DIY kits for embedded development which support OpenEmbedded. BeagleBoard and Gumstix are two that have a growing community and a good name for themselves.

Over the weekend I had the pleasure of borrowing a Gumstix Overo Earth with the Tobi expansion board to see if I could get Node.js running on it before I bought my own. I'm going to give you the red-green step-through starting with a bitbake build of a console-image using the default gumstix opkg repository (I believe this is a clone of the Angstrom repo - the same as BeagleBoard, etc - with a few tweaks), but assuming you have the OpenEmbedded environment of your choice up and running, the instructions should be pretty much the same.

Prerequisits:
-------------
  * A [pre-built](http://www.gumstix.net/Setup-and-Programming/view/Getting-started/Working-with-pre-built-images/111.html) or [hand-tailored](http://www.gumstix.net/Setup-and-Programming/view/Overo-Setup-and-Programming/Setting-up-a-build-environment/111.html) console image.
  * An SD card with a [specially crafted partition layout](http://www.gumstix.net/Documentation/view/User-How-To-s/Booting-from-microSD/SD/MMC/109.html)
  * A basic understanding of [opkg](http://www.gumstix.net/Setup-and-Programming/view/Overo-Setup-and-Programming/Installing-additional-sw-packages/111.html?mosmsg=Changes+to+item+saved)

Note on Rolling your own
------------------------
**Rolling your own** is always optional and is done on your host system (the x86 or x86-84 box you cross-compile from, not the OpenEmbedded device).
You will need to find the ipk files in a sub-directory of `./tmp/deploy/glibc/ipk/`, copy them over with `scp`, and install them with `opkg install _package-name_.ipk`


Red
===

    cd ~/
    wget http://nodejs.org/dist/node-v0.1.102.tar.gz
    tar xf node-v0.1.102.tar.gz
    cd node-v0.1.102
    ./configure
    make

And we see that we don't have gcc...


task-sdk-native: The native arm compiler
========================================

Rolling your own: several hours
-----------------

    bitbake task-sdk-native

On some Linuxes (Ubuntu pre-10.04, for example) you will get [an error][xz-error] 

    /bin/sh: xz: command not found 
    tar: This does not look like a tar archive 
    tar: Exiting with failure status due to previous errors 
    NOTE: Task failed: 
    ERROR: TaskFailed event exception, aborting 
    ERROR: Build of /home/mark/overo-oe/org.openembedded.dev/recipes/grep/grep_2.6.3.bb do_unpack failed 
    ERROR: Task 1727 (/home/mark/overo-oe/org.openembedded.dev/recipes/grep/grep_2.6.3.bb, do_unpack) failed

    ERROR: '/home/mark/overo-oe/org.openembedded.dev/recipes/grep/grep_2.6.3.bb' failed 

This is because `lzma` has been replaced by `xz-utils`. You can run `apt-get install xz-utils` and [safely ignore][xz-warn] the warning that by uninstalling `lzma` that `You are about to do something potentially harmful.` and enter `Yes, do as I say!`.

Installing from the repo: several minutes
-------------------------

    opkg install task-sdk-native


Now let's try again.

    cd ~/node-v0.1.102
    make

And we see that we don't have python


python: runs the WAF compiler tools
===================================

This first error is that python isn't installed, that seems intuitive enough to fix

    ./configure 
    /usr/bin/env: python: No such file or directory
    opkg install python

Next is a BOM enocding error. This has to do with utf-8 / unicode / ISOxxxx stuff.

    ./configure
      File "/home/root/node-v0.1.102/tools/waf-light", line 2
    SyntaxError: encoding problem: with BOM    
    # edit /home/root/node-v0.1.102/tools/waf-light
    # change `# encoding: ISO8859-1` to `# encoding: utf-8`
    
shutil is missing. After some hunting, I found it.

    ./configure 
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/home/root/node-v0.1.102/tools/waf-light", line 157, in <module>
        import Scripting
      File "/home/root/node-v0.1.102/tools/wafadmin/Scripting.py", line 7, in <module>
        import os, sys, shutil, traceback, datetime, inspect, errno
    ImportError: No module named shutil
    opkg install python-modules

The next error is quite interesting. You'd think string would be part of python

    ./configure
    ImportError: No module named string
    opkg install python-distutils

We find that the gcc compiler isn't installed, which almost seems like we're getting out of the python errors... but not quite

    ./configure 
    Checking for program g++ or c++          : not found 
    Checking for program icpc                : not found 
    Checking for program c++                 : not found 
    /home/root/node-v0.1.102/wscript:130: error: could not configure a cxx compiler!
    opkg install task-sdk-native

Finally our last python error - python doesn't know which platform we're on. I would like to note that *misc*, *util*, *modules*, and *tools* are terrible names for packages...

    ./configure
    /home/root/node-v0.1.102/deps/c-ares/wscript: error: Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/home/root/node-v0.1.102/tools/wafadmin/Utils.py", line 274, in load_module
        exec(compile(code, file_path, 'exec'), module.__dict__)
      File "/home/root/node-v0.1.102/deps/c-ares/wscript", line 2, in <module>
        import platform
    ImportError: No module named platform
    opkg install python-misc
    
And now on to compiler errors...

v8: the engine behind node
==========================

I knew that the [OMAP3530 has thumb support](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture), so this was confusing

    /home/root/node-v0.1.101/deps/v8/src/arm/macro-assembler-arm.cc:59:3: error: #error "For thumb inter-working we require an architecture which supports blx"
    scons: *** [obj/release/arm/macro-assembler-arm.o] Error 1
    scons: building terminated because of errors.
    Waf: Leaving directory `/home/root/node-v0.1.101/build'
    Build failed:  -> task failed (err #2): 
            {task: libv8.a SConstruct -> libv8.a}
    make: *** [all] Error 1

At first I thought the best course of action was to fake CAN_USE_THUMB_INSTRUCTIONS by manually defining it in the code

    g++ -o obj/release/platform-linux.o -c -Wall -W -Wno-unused-parameter -Wnon-virtual-dtor -pedantic -O3 -fomit-frame-pointer -fdata-sections -ffunction-sections -ansi -fno-rtti -fno-exceptions -Wall -W -Wno-unused-parameterc
    /tmp/ccNcgrdW.s: Assembler messages:
    /tmp/ccNcgrdW.s:150: Error: bad instruction `int $3'
    scons: *** [obj/release/platform-linux.o] Error 1
    scons: building terminated because of errors.
    Waf: Leaving directory `/home/root/node-v0.1.101/build'
    Build failed:  -> task failed (err #2): 
            {task: libv8.a SConstruct -> libv8.a}
    make: *** [all] Error 1

But that wasn't enough so I figured __ARM_V7_A__ should be faked too

    /tmp/ccxCSjUb.s: Assembler messages:
    /tmp/ccxCSjUb.s:47: Error: selected processor does not support `bkpt 0'
    scons: *** [obj/release/arm/cpu-arm.o] Error 1
    scons: building terminated because of errors.
    Waf: Leaving directory `/home/root/node-v0.1.101/build'
    Build failed:  -> task failed (err #2): 
      {task: libv8.a SConstruct -> libv8.a}
    make: *** [all] Error 1

Further investigation revealed that the compiler was faking (and forcing) the platform to appear as an ARMv4:

    touch foo.cc
    g++ foo.cc -dM -E | grep ARM
    #define __ARMEL__ 1
    #define __ARM_ARCH_4T__ 1
    #define __ARM_EABI__ 1

I found that the way to fix this is to use [`-march`, `-mtune`, and `-mcpu` flags](http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/ARM-Options.html):

    touch foo.cc
    g++ foo.cc -march=armv7-a -mtune=cortex-a8 -dM -E | grep ARM
    #define __ARMEL__ 1
    #define __ARM_ARCH_7A__ 1
    #define __ARM_EABI__ 1

I couldn't figure out how to pass compiler arguments directly to [WAF](http://freehackers.org/~tnagy/wafbook)

    ./configure -march=armv7-a
    waf-light: error: no such option: -march
    
I did find that WAF respects environment variables.

    export CC='gcc -march=armv7-a'
    export CXX='g++ -march=armv7-a'

Viola!
    
    make
    #... lots of successful output
    Waf: Leaving directory `/home/root/node-v0.1.101/build'
    'build' finished successfully (40m36.030s)

Other Notes
========
    
production: node.js - without python and gcc
-------------------------

I believe the binary `node` is the only thing necessary to be able to run node, assuming that the shared libraries that it is linked against are present - those being `openssl` and *optionally* `v8`, `libev`, `libio`.

You shouldn't need python, or g++. However, you will need libcstd++

    overo-oe/tmp/work/armv7a-angstrom-linux-gnueabi/gcc-cross-4.3.3-r12.1/staging-pkg/deploy/glibc/ipk/armv7a/libstdc++6_4.3.3-r12.1.5_armv7a.ipk

openssl support
---------------

    opkg install openssl
    opkg install openssl-dev

running on other distros
---------------

    librt.so.1 => /lib/librt.so.1 (0x40026000)
    libssl.so.0.9.8 => /usr/lib/libssl.so.0.9.8 (0x40035000)
    libcrypto.so.0.9.8 => /usr/lib/libcrypto.so.0.9.8 (0x4007c000)
    libdl.so.2 => /lib/libdl.so.2 (0x401a3000)
    libm.so.6 => /lib/libm.so.6 (0x401ae000)
    libgcc_s.so.1 => /lib/libgcc_s.so.1 (0x40221000)
    libpthread.so.0 => /lib/libpthread.so.0 (0x40233000)
    libc.so.6 => /lib/libc.so.6 (0x40252000)
    /lib/ld-linux.so.3 (0x40000000)

Leftover warnings
-----------------

I'm pretty sure that sync_file_range is a fairly new operation that isn't implemented in all file io libraries yet.

    default/deps/libeio/eio_1.o: In function `eio__sync_file_range':
    /home/root/node-v0.1.102/build/../deps/libeio/eio.c:872: warning: warning: sync_file_range is not implemented and will always fail


creating a static binary
========================

And the solution is to add `conf.env["FULLSTATIC"] = True` to the wscript

TODO: create a patch for this and post it to the mailing list

    vim wscript
    
      opt.add_option( '--shared-libev-libpath'
                    , action='store'
                    , default=False
                    , help='A directory to search for the shared libev DLL'
                    , dest='shared_libev_libpath'
                    )
    
    +  opt.add_option( '--static'
    +                , action='store'
    +                , default=False
    +                , help='Whether to compile node statically'
    +                , dest='full_static'
    +                )
    
    def configure(conf):
      conf.check_tool('compiler_cxx')
      if not conf.env.CXX: conf.fatal('c++ compiler not found')
      conf.check_tool('compiler_cc')
      if not conf.env.CC: conf.fatal('c compiler not found')

      o = Options.options

      conf.env["USE_DEBUG"] = o.debug

      # TODO --static = o.static
    +  conf.env["FULLSTATIC"] = o.full_static
      conf.env["USE_SHARED_V8"] = o.shared_v8 or o.shared_v8_includes or o.shared_v8_libpath or o.shared_v8_libname
      conf.env["USE_SHARED_CARES"] = o.shared_cares or o.shared_cares_includes or o.shared_cares_libpath
      conf.env["USE_SHARED_LIBEV"] = o.shared_libev or o.shared_libev_includes or o.shared_libev_libpath


You can't link static libraries against dynamic libraries, so your friendly error might look like:

    /arm-angstrom-linux-gnueabi/bin/ld: cannot find -lssl
    opkg install openssl-static
    make
